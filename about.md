 I have no idea what I am writing about most days and if you actually search the [archive](http://jimwrites.com/archive)
 you will definitely agree with me.

 In fact, I don't even know what to write here. What I do know is what I want to do is write or have some
 space on the web to hang my shingle so here we are.

 I hope to have written more than the few small posts I have written so far here and over time
 I will build an audience. I had thought about using all those newsletters that are popular right now
 like [ghost](http://ghost.org) or [substack](http://substack.com) but as this is a long term
 project for me that I hope will be for decades I didn't want to risk tying myself to a platform. heck, that's one of the reasons why I [quit twitter](https://jimwrites.com/2023/04/22/goodbye-twitter/
 )because even though it's the internet darling today it might not be tomorrow.

 So, I'm using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [firebase hosting](htttp://firebase.com) combined with any
 text editor I find to get my words from my head to the screen. It's not the most streamlined
 system but for me it works.

 I have no grandeur ideas of getting rich with this. Some of these newsletter services make it sound
 so easy: you just press some keys on your keyboard and the money flows out. And for a few, I bet this
 is the case.

 I currently use all free services so I'm good with breaking even ;)

 The goal is to write. It's hard to explain but once you get going it almost becomes addictive and
 you can't stop. The problem I currently have is [lack of time](https://jimwrites.com/2023/04/23/about-twenty-minutes/)
 but perhaps when the little one gets a little older I will find more time. Again, this is a long
 term project.  I'm okay with even **one** reader a decade from now.

 Anyway, enough.

 I'm Jim. I write. Hello.
