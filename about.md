# About!

This is a silly idea. No, it's a **really silly idea** and I'm doing it anyway. I am writing about **all my stuff**

All of it. 

Why? Well for a few reasons...

1. To see if I can create something out of thin air.
2. Maybe I'll make a buck or two
3. I want to start writing more. I just need to find the time. 

Time is one of the main reasons I decided to do this: It doesn't take a long time to get a blog post out - maybe 20 minutes or so, and that's about all I have. 

I also like to try out new technologies and  this allows me to try out different blogging platforms from time to time or other software that allows me to write. 

One last thing is of course to see if could build an audience. Will you care abOut what I write? Will you return? 

Can I get this site to show up on the search engines at all? Can I rank a site that has **no** images at all and just text? 

These are the questions that keep me up at night. Besides, it's either this or doom scroll and this seems a little more productive. 

As I write this I have absolutely **no** visitors so I am not too worried about what I write about at this time. I also want to make this a long-term project as I have a lot of stuff and this will  **take a long time** so I might as well get started before my time runs out. 

Here's hoping I make it. 

ps.
