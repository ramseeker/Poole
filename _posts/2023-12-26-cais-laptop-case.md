[Cais laptop case]( https://amzn.to/3tAH9n1)

This is a pretty good laptop case. Or perhaps it's more of a laptop sleeve. Regardless, it's soft on the inside and has a pocket but it's a tight fit so I don't recommend jamming a charger in there. 

You will need a notebook with pretty good battery life or look for a different case.

He hated the fact that he couldn't just stay at home all day as that's what he really wanted to do. Stay home and write. By the time he retired 5 years from now he had hoped that his writing would at very least supplement his retirement income. 

The reality was different and he sighed and put on warm pants and his vest. 

He didn't think he would be delivering smiles for th ‘zon but that's how it all worked out. 

Groceries were expensive and he couldn't just write and hope that the money would come. He was another struggling artist

Could he call himself an artist if he was just writing fiction for his blog? He thought so. He was making something after all.  Currently no it was reading what he was making, bit that is actually okay as he could experiment and learn and improve without having an audience

This was the side hustle, using the bit of time he had on breaks to write. 

But the break was onerr and he hadn't finished his post but at least it was a start. 

He sighed, jammed the laptop back inits case a started the truck. That was all the writing he was going to get in today.
