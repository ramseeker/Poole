I'm afraid I may have created a monster. I am now constantly pestered to **turn off the lights** every time I leave a room. 

Why? I switched our electric service to [voluntary time of use](https://www.nationalgridus.com/electric-vehicle-hub/Programs/Upstate-New-York/) seening as we both have electric cars. 

It seemed silly to pay the same rate for 24 hours regardless of time. I went from spending 9 cents per KWh to 1 cent per KWh. 

It was already a pretty good deal when you compare gas vs electric vehicles, but now it's even a better deal. 

At first I wasn't going to bother as they have to come out and change your meter and that's a pain - or so I though - but it turned out I didn't need to even be home when it happened so that worked out well.

The cheaper rates are essentially from 11pm to 7am and then weekends - just like the long distance times for [POTS phones](https://www.google.com/search?q=pots+phone+meaning) back in the day. It's cheaper during the days when business is closed. 

Anyway, it's been a good thing to do so far and cheaper electricity is always a good thing. 

Except. Except. 

Now the boss has become the hdyro-police. Lights get turned off on me and we can no longer at any time that's even remotely convenient. 

You can call me at 3am as I will probably be awake doing laundry.
