He never really liked the [cheap mice](https://amzn.to/47Zwja6) he kept buying but he had thought that all mice are the same and they really didn't matter. 

Sure, he had read about [gaming mice](https://amzn.to/47Zwja6) before but he didn't think much about them as he was a writer and not a gamer at all. He never really got into gaming and he didn't know why really but then he had other hbbies so it wasn't like he wasn't always busy. 

But then he managed to pick one up when he bought a laptop and the store tossed in the Rival 3 Wireless mouse for free. It looked better than any cheap [Amazon Basics mouse](https://amzn.to/3BzjpDz) he was used to so he figured he had nothing to lose by giving it a go. 

It turns out he loved it and it was all that he really needed when it came to getting a mouse that actually worked. He thought he had tried them all -[ the Apple mice](https://amzn.to/3XWDQBShttps://amzn.to/3XWDQBS) and trackpads, but nothing stood out as spectacular for him. 

Until he got the rival 3 wireless mouse and then for the first time in a long time he was happy with the mouse. It had enough buttons but not too many and they seemed to be in the right space at the right time. *Nobody* has time to read a mouse manual he thought to himself. 

Finally, he had a mouse he could use on the regular that wasn't a peice of junk.
