[Ozium Air Freshener](https://amzn.to/3tvMmfY)

This stuff works very well at actually killing odors instead of just masking them. Seems to last forever too.

He was warned.  

“She's gonna be farty” she warned him as he handed her the dog bine for Christmas

How bad could it be? he thought. 
The bag said they were highly digestive so how could it be? 

It took the dog a few hours to get through the bone and then a few hours, the stink started. 

She was right. Again 

The smell was so bad. He had never smelled anything so bad in his life. Thankfully he had bought the Ozium to freshen the car and he gave the living room a good spray

But what would he do with the $35
00 worth of bones he had bought? Should he throw them out? Should he keep feeding them to the dog and hope her gastrointestinal issues would sort themselves out over time? 

He did have the Ozium after all and the dog loved the bones so it seemed a shame to deny her the special treat. 

He did have the Ozium after all.
