She had a love/hate relationship with the car wash. She loved the lights, and the bubbles but hated the noise. 

What to do?  I couldn't take her to vacuum the car because she couldn't handle the noise - but she wanted to go. She begged me to go. 

The solution? [Noise cancelling earpads for kid](https://amzn.to/4awbUKx). She **loves them** and can now go with me to the car wash. She looks a little bit dopey, but whatever.  At least we have a clean car for Christmas
