I have tried a [lot](apple.com) of different things to write with and
I keep on coming back to [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to write with. 

Yes, it's not as easy or friendly as [substack](http://substack.com), but I think I like it better

With this as my app of choice I can write easily and quickly - something I could not do with substack. 

I like writing in the terminal as it's **way faster** than any other method i have tried.
