T'was the night before the night before the night before Christmas
I was snug in the house
I was downstairs with my computer and mouse

When all of a sudden I heard such a racket,
I ran from the bottom to the top of the house

"I peed my pants", came the worried reply
I raced up the stairs trying to disguise all my sighs

Don't worry I said,  these things happen to you. 
It could have been worse. It could have been poo.

The floor was all wet, and new pajamas were needed
I had just put her to bed, but I hadn't succeeded

For now I had mopping and changing to do. 
But not to worry my child it's entirely okay. 

Accidents happen and won't happen one day 
But now go to bed. Santa's loading his sleigh.
