Season's Greetings from all of us!

We did very little this year as far as gifts go. The wife and I gave each other a few trinkets but no **real big gifts** as we're going on an internation trip next month, so: money. 

The wee one did get a few things. A small digital camera that's as good as the ones I used to **want so bad** in the early aughts. It's funny how technology advances - the digital camera I gave her came with a memory card, reader and all the charging cables for $20. I don't think an iPhone comes with cables these days. 

It's a very warm holiday this year, compared to the [blizzard of '22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_2022_North_American_winter_storm) we experienced on Christmas day  this year is downright balmy!

So, we're happy and healthy and gave the just right amount of gifts!
