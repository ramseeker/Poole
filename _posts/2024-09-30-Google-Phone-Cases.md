He wanted a new phone. 

His wife said no, they are too much money. He had a phone. It wa a **fine phone** and he did not need to spend any more money on technology. He already had laptops and monitors and gosh knows how many cables in the basement. 

He wanted a new phone

He knew he didn't need a new phone. His current phone was fine. But, he wanted a new phone. His wife said no. 

He knew better than to cross her and get the phone anyway  because when she said no, she said no. He respected that and was one of the resasons he married her. Until today. 

Today was differerent. The kids were grown and long gone. Even the youngest one had just graduated college and was living alone in the big city. He remembered living in the big city and how it was late at night with the lights and sirens and sounds of the streetcar past his window on the half hour. 

When he was single, he bought what he wanted when he wanted, but now he shared a life with someone. Someone he loved, and if she said no there was probably a good reason why and he respected that. 

He decided to trick her then. He would walk in the door with the old phone but a new phone case. He looked and bought the brightest  and splashiest phone case he could find. 


He wrapped his old phone in the new case and walked inside. He set the phone on the table and thought to himself: *this is going to be good*
