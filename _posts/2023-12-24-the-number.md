I've chased a lot of numbers over the years. I have wanted to be older when I was young and younger when I have been older. 

I have had numbers on a screen show I owe people a lot of money,and I have had numbers on a screen showing that I have **some** money at least. 

I have child who identifies by her age - also a number

Heck, I have a license plate number and a house number. 

I have lots of numbers. Some I like and some I don't and some I care about and some I never will. I have an [**alien number**](https://www.google.com/search?q=alien+number) for crying out loud.

The number I want to care most of all is the **number of posts** number you see at the top of the page. At writing, it's a 40. I want that to be 1000 and then 2000, and so on

Why? Because I want to be known a writer and not an Uber Driver. And to do so I figure I have to write. A lot. 

It doesn't matter **what app** I use to either write or publish, and believe me when I tell you I am pretty sure I have found and tried most of them and they all have thier flaws. The apps and tools have long been the distraction. It's a lot more fun to be a part of the **new darling** of writing site or social media or whatever.

It's a lot more fun to stall writing. It's a lot more fun to tweak this sites design over and over again, until I get it **just right**. 

It's not as much  fun to put yourself out there. I write with too many commas,[^1] and my sentence structure isn't the best either. I haven't learned to type correctly so the backspace button is my favorite button. 

**All of it doesn't matter**

I just have to write. I want to tell people I write and have written and been self published. I don't need to submit my writing to publishers as **I am the publisher**. 

What matters is I push the keys on the keyboard and then make the words and sentences happen. Then I push **publish**. 

And then I do it again, and again. I am hoping my writing will suck less and less over time and I will become better at the 'craft' of writing. Or, maybe I won't. 

I do know that I want that number at the top of the page to count higher and higher. I think if I do that, all the other details should take care of themselves.
