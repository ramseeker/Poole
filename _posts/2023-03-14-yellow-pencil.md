"How come there's never a pencil when you need it" he thought as he rummaged through the junk drawer in the kitchen. Ther was string, batteries,
toothpicks, and pens galore - but no pencil. 

He couldn't belive that there was no pencil in the house. How could that be? The wife was a teacher. Maybe she had one in her office. Nope. 

Junk drawer, there **had to be one** in the junk drawer, right? Nope.
