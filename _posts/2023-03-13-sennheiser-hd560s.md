He needed another pair of heapdhones like he needed a hole in the head. He was up too... a number too embarrasing to actually say out loud. But they were a deal. He had to have them.

They arrived and they are pretty good. Yes, they are made out of plastic and yes they are cheap (compared to some others) but they also sound very nice and were bought used so the savings are pretty great!

He has found himself listening these a lot. They're black and boring too so they're easy to sneak into the house too.

Besides, what's one more pair?
